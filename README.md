# Demand Side Management On A Budget!

This repository offers a comprehensive Demand Side Management (DSM) solution tailored to the unique needs of consulting engineers. While these professionals possess considerable expertise in their domain, they might not have in-depth knowledge in areas such as IT, database management, Operational Technology (OT), and cybersecurity. Recognizing this, our repository furnishes Python scripts designed for initial electrical load analysis, algorithm testing using a straightforward Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for forecasting electrical data, and a streamlined edge device application suitable for user-friendly Linux devices like the Raspberry Pi.

Our choice of electrical sub-metering tool is the eGauge, renowned for its robustness and simplicity in setup. Not only does it function as a database, storing up to a year's worth of data, but it also doubles as a dashboard, showcasing charts and offering data download capabilities. Additionally, eGauge offers a "mirror" site feature. Provided the eGauge is online, consulting engineers can access the manufacturer's mirror site, allowing remote viewing and data download without necessitating intricate cybersecurity configurations typical of IT engagements.

The server application extracts the eGauge's power readings via Modbus every minute and manages the algorithm pivotal to the DSM strategy. Moreover, the repository incorporates a financial directory equipped with an Excel spreadsheet, encapsulating the theme "Demand Side Management on a Budget".

The overarching objective is to empower consulting engineers, who are adept in building systems and articulating operational sequences for continuous load management. This solution offers a robust platform, eliminating the need for extensive IT, cybersecurity, IoT, or database management proficiencies. Instead, it leans into the engineer's core skills: devising engineering solutions, conveying operational sequences to control contractors, executing and troubleshooting Python scripts, configuring simple Linux devices like the Raspberry Pi in the field, coordinating eGauge meter setups with electricians, and as a best practice, ensuring that operational sequences meet DSM objectives.
